## Read of the tape
- **CRM** leads on momentum (strong 3m run) with acceptable quality — cleanest composite.
- **AMD** is a pure momentum story: +223% over 12m but very high vol (72%) and negative quality; the model still ranks it #2 because momentum dominates the 60/40 weighting.
- **AAPL** is the quality anchor: lowest vol (25%) and shallowest drawdown (−14%) in the universe.
- **AVGO/ORCL** are the clear laggards: negative 3m and 12m returns with elevated vol.
